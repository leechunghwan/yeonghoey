* Get the name of the current file
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  For example, in directory /abc the command vim def/my.txt would edit file /abc/def/my.txt.

  :echo @%                def/my.txt       directory/name of file (relative to the current working directory of /abc)
  :echo expand('%:t')     my.txt           name of file ('tail')
  :echo expand('%:p')     /abc/def/my.txt  full path
  :echo expand('%:p:h')   /abc/def         directory containing file ('head')
  :echo expand('%:p:h:t') def              :p (/abc/def/my.txt), then  :h (/abc/def), then  :t (def)
  :echo expand('%:r')     my               name of file less one extension ('root')
  :echo expand('%:e')     txt              name of file's extension ('extension')
