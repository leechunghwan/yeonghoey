** Metrics
- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html

Metrics consist of  ~Minimum~, ~Maximum~, ~Sum~, ~Average~, ~SampleCount~, ~pNN.NN~.
To interpret them clearly, we need to know the *sampling rate*.
Mostly, the metrics of AWS resources explicitly state their *sampling rate* on their documentation.

Basic (*five-minute*) monitoring is enabled by default.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The metrics that you configure for your streams are automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch *every minute*.
